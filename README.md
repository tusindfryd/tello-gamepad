# tello-gamepad (work in progress)
## ðŸŽ®ðŸ›¸ fly tello drones with a gamepad

*using the [JS Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/), and [DJITelloPy](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/)*

### Installation
- Clone the repository and install the requirements with `pip -r requirements.txt`. Make sure your Python version is 3.10 or higher.
- Connect to a Tello drone and a gamepad.
- Run `python main.py`; the command line output will show that the server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` - run the browser and see if everything is working properly.

### Notes
Smooth movement is not possible yet (drone moves 20 cm at a time after a button press, with latency).
